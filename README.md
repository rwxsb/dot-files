In this branch I've applied lazy.nvim by folke, it seems easier to use and mostly useful
plugins are included. I will use this and learn this instead of trying to configure my own
it works with the way I work and I can always add more plugins if I need to.

In the future I should do a fork of folke/lazy.nvim
